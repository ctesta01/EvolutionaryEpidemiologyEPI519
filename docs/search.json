    "text": "3 Diversity\nThe state of COVID-19 in this time last year (2022):\nName some Is plasmodium more related to humans or bacteria? Humans! Because it’s eukaryotic.\nBasically everything except archaea have been found to be infectious.\nGetting the biology right matters. Not only to avoid needless antibiotic prescriptions. Bacteria, viruses, protozoa are very different!\nEverything that can be seen with the naked eye is contained in the three nodes labeled: homo, coprius (fungi), zea (maize).\nWhy are archaea not pathogenic?\n(Bill doesn’t necessarily agree with the think-piece above, just included to show you can write such a think-piece).\nIf a person with anthrax boarded a transatlantic flight, how many of their fellow passengers would you expected to be infected on arrival?\nAnthrax is a bacillus, ancillus anthrasis, which produces a toxin.\nThe answer is nil because it does not transmit via humans — it transmits via spores.\nEven the most deadly form of anthrax, which people have spent years trying to make transmissible, isn’t transmissible.\nHow do pathogens adapt?\nWhat do you think is being selected at different points?\nSimultaneously:\nD614G is an infection point developed very early — famous for increasing the affinity of the spike to the receptor. Alpha and delta also had similar mutations. More and more people developed immunity to the original virus. Immune evasion and immune escape are key. After that, the peak was really slow so it built up a lot of immunity. This poses a big survival pressure.\nDo we think that if omicron infected such a large proportion, would this drive more variation or diversity in subsequent lineages? Actually, we’ve mostly seen omicron sub-lineages recently rather than distant lineages.\nEarly stage adaptation is all about host infectivity, and later on is all about immune evasion.\nShout-out some things that are being adapted:\nWhat matters particularly at the start? Transmissibility; infectivity; generation time. What doesn’t matter at the start? Immune evasion — because everyone is susceptible. The advantage of immune evasion hardly exists.\nDoes immune evasion always mean adaptive immune evasion? Because isn’t the first step immunity when there’s animal to human transmission?\n\\(R_0\\) of wild type was around 3, \\(R_0\\) of alpha was around ~4.5, delta was around ~6 (replicated very quickly)\nFor delta, a large number of viruses were there before the immune system could catch it — so it was able to infect and transmit from individuals who had immunity, without any of the “rinky-dinky stuff that omicron has.”\nWhat’s selected for later? Immune evasion.\nWhat’s selected for now? We have lots of immunity, lots of types with immune evasion,\nWho has heard of “HV.1”? HV.1 is derivative of EG5 which just became the main derivative Mutation in 452, better able to attach to cells. This is similar to what made XBB better than 1Q.1.\nImportantly, one cannot have an ever-increasing \\(R_0\\). Like, an \\(R_0\\) of 8 vs. 9 is not as much of a difference between \\(R_0\\) of 2 and 3. In other words, past a certain point, “everyone gets infected,” whereas at the lower boundaries we have differences in the pace of domination.\nAccording to Plague Inc, routes of transmission:\nDespite the unrealism of this, there are overlaps and the boundaries of these things are not absolute.\nFrom https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/930797\nCan you think of a disease that has changed its transmission route?\nDepends if we’re allowed to think about diseases with changes in its host"

He and others wrote eagerly awaiting for hard evidence of its implications: that there is eukaryotic life in space capable of sustaining viral evolution.\nViruses are:\n\nmetabolically inert,\nreplicate only within the cells of living hosts\nHave a RNA or DNA genome, a protein coat, and, in more complex types, a surrounding envelope.\n\nRNA vs. DNA: * Both nucleic acids – ribonucleic and deoxyribonucleic * We use double stranded DNA, the double helix * But viruses are much more variable\nViruses typically have high mutation rates — especially RNA viruses\n\nRNA is less stable than DNA\nA single strand is less stable than a double strand\nThe things that copy RNA can’t correct their mistakes\nRetroviruses use RNA, but copy it to DNA (using reverse transcriptase)\nAll these things mean that viruses generate variation quickly\n\n \nEach genome can only accumulate a limited amount of change per generation, thought to be due to not-coincidental. If something mutates too slowly, there’s not sufficient variation for adaptation and evolution to occur. If there’s too much, then there’s potential for a mutational meltdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecombination in viruses – it’s not just for bacteria\n\n\nBecause influenza has 9 “chunks of genes” (chromosomes?) that are already segmented — so you don’t need anything special for recombination. If one cell gets infected by multiple flu viruses, the segments can recombin. Each segment codes for different proteins that are part of the virus.\nWe call this antigenic shift.\n\n\n\n\nH1N1 from 2009\n\n\nHow can we be sure something is a swine virus?

Rare types frequently have an advantage.\nExamples include antigens, phage receptors.\nBalancing selection: Selection that maintains genotypes at intermediate frequency.\nE.g., from the microbiome. If a bacteria A depends on bacteria B for nutrients and vice versa, then we would expect to find them together.\nPossibly different serotypes for various pathogens.\nExamples: sickle cell genes.\nPurifying selection: Highly conserved genes with very little variation in protein sequence.\nMutants are likely to be less fit, so they are purged by selection. E.g., most protein coding genes are subject to purifying selection.\nWhat kinds of selection does the SARS-CoV-2 spike experience? Most of these, with a possible exception of balancing.\nWhat kinds of selection affect the genetic and phenotypic variation? Almost all positive and purifying selection.\nWe can’t experiment, but we can do case-follow-up.\nWe can also do genetic association tests.\nRelative reproductive success:\nThe change in the frequency of a gene from one generation to the next.
