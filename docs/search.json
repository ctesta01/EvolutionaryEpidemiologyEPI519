    "text": "3 Diversity\nThe state of COVID-19 in this time last year (2022):\nName some Is plasmodium more related to humans or bacteria? Humans! Because it’s eukaryotic.\nBasically everything except archaea have been found to be infectious.\nGetting the biology right matters. Not only to avoid needless antibiotic prescriptions. Bacteria, viruses, protozoa are very different!\nEverything that can be seen with the naked eye is contained in the three nodes labeled: homo, coprius (fungi), zea (maize).\nWhy are archaea not pathogenic?\n(Bill doesn’t necessarily agree with the think-piece above, just included to show you can write such a think-piece).\nIf a person with anthrax boarded a transatlantic flight, how many of their fellow passengers would you expected to be infected on arrival?\nAnthrax is a bacillus, ancillus anthrasis, which produces a toxin.\nThe answer is nil because it does not transmit via humans — it transmits via spores.\nEven the most deadly form of anthrax, which people have spent years trying to make transmissible, isn’t transmissible.\nHow do pathogens adapt?\nWhat do you think is being selected at different points?\nSimultaneously:\nD614G is an infection point developed very early — famous for increasing the affinity of the spike to the receptor. Alpha and delta also had similar mutations. More and more people developed immunity to the original virus. Immune evasion and immune escape are key. After that, the peak was really slow so it built up a lot of immunity. This poses a big survival pressure.\nDo we think that if omicron infected such a large proportion, would this drive more variation or diversity in subsequent lineages? Actually, we’ve mostly seen omicron sub-lineages recently rather than distant lineages.\nEarly stage adaptation is all about host infectivity, and later on is all about immune evasion.\nShout-out some things that are being adapted:\nWhat matters particularly at the start? Transmissibility; infectivity; generation time. What doesn’t matter at the start? Immune evasion — because everyone is susceptible. The advantage of immune evasion hardly exists.\nDoes immune evasion always mean adaptive immune evasion? Because isn’t the first step immunity when there’s animal to human transmission?\n\\(R_0\\) of wild type was around 3, \\(R_0\\) of alpha was around ~4.5, delta was around ~6 (replicated very quickly)\nFor delta, a large number of viruses were there before the immune system could catch it — so it was able to infect and transmit from individuals who had immunity, without any of the “rinky-dinky stuff that omicron has.”\nWhat’s selected for later? Immune evasion.\nWhat’s selected for now? We have lots of immunity, lots of types with immune evasion,\nWho has heard of “HV.1”? HV.1 is derivative of EG5 which just became the main derivative Mutation in 452, better able to attach to cells. This is similar to what made XBB better than 1Q.1.\nImportantly, one cannot have an ever-increasing \\(R_0\\). Like, an \\(R_0\\) of 8 vs. 9 is not as much of a difference between \\(R_0\\) of 2 and 3. In other words, past a certain point, “everyone gets infected,” whereas at the lower boundaries we have differences in the pace of domination.\nAccording to Plague Inc, routes of transmission:\nDespite the unrealism of this, there are overlaps and the boundaries of these things are not absolute.\nFrom https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/930797\nCan you think of a disease that has changed its transmission route?\nDepends if we’re allowed to think about diseases with changes in its host"

He and others wrote eagerly awaiting for hard evidence of its implications: that there is eukaryotic life in space capable of sustaining viral evolution.\nViruses are:\n\nmetabolically inert,\nreplicate only within the cells of living hosts\nHave a RNA or DNA genome, a protein coat, and, in more complex types, a surrounding envelope.\n\nRNA vs. DNA: * Both nucleic acids – ribonucleic and deoxyribonucleic * We use double stranded DNA, the double helix * But viruses are much more variable\nViruses typically have high mutation rates — especially RNA viruses\n\nRNA is less stable than DNA\nA single strand is less stable than a double strand\nThe things that copy RNA can’t correct their mistakes\nRetroviruses use RNA, but copy it to DNA (using reverse transcriptase)\nAll these things mean that viruses generate variation quickly\n\n \nEach genome can only accumulate a limited amount of change per generation, thought to be due to not-coincidental. If something mutates too slowly, there’s not sufficient variation for adaptation and evolution to occur. If there’s too much, then there’s potential for a mutational meltdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecombination in viruses – it’s not just for bacteria\n\n\nBecause influenza has 9 “chunks of genes” (chromosomes?) that are already segmented — so you don’t need anything special for recombination. If one cell gets infected by multiple flu viruses, the segments can recombin. Each segment codes for different proteins that are part of the virus.\nWe call this antigenic shift.\n\n\n\n\nH1N1 from 2009\n\n\nHow can we be sure something is a swine virus?

Rare types frequently have an advantage.\nExamples include antigens, phage receptors.\nBalancing selection: Selection that maintains genotypes at intermediate frequency.\nE.g., from the microbiome. If a bacteria A depends on bacteria B for nutrients and vice versa, then we would expect to find them together.\nPossibly different serotypes for various pathogens.\nExamples: sickle cell genes.\nPurifying selection: Highly conserved genes with very little variation in protein sequence.\nMutants are likely to be less fit, so they are purged by selection. E.g., most protein coding genes are subject to purifying selection.\nWhat kinds of selection does the SARS-CoV-2 spike experience? Most of these, with a possible exception of balancing.\nWhat kinds of selection affect the genetic and phenotypic variation? Almost all positive and purifying selection.\nWe can’t experiment, but we can do case-follow-up.\nWe can also do genetic association tests.\nRelative reproductive success:\nThe change in the frequency of a gene from one generation to the next.

You cannot weight transitions the same as transversions in a distance metric.\nFor many of these triplets, the third nucleotide has no effect in what is coded.\nImagine comparing the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous change – dN/dS. What does it mean if this is small? And if it is large?\nMore synonymous than non-synonymous change is associated with purifying change, and vice versa.\nWork by Korber et al 2000\nThe dN/dS ratio is often larger when comparing more closely related things. Especially evident with epidemiologic data, where they may share an ancestor a few years ago. Why?\nGenetic drift\nTime wasn’t enough to weed out the bad non-synonymous mutations.\nAnswer: Incomplete purifying selection.\nWe never see mutations that are incredibly lethal to the species, but we can see mutations that are somewhat or close to lethal to the species.\nJohn Maynard Smith is in Bill’s intellectual lineage;\nHis address is given as Haldane’s Right Hand Side — Haldane was his advisor.\nGroup the most similar together (smallest distance) are grouped together at an additional node.\nContinue to add sequences until none are left.\nAn iterative process, where we start by joining the closest, then the next closest, etc., etc.,\nBut we need to weight the process by a substitution model.\nSuch clustering algorithms:\nUnifying the Epidemiological and Evolutionary Dynamics of Pathogens\nIn theory, influenza needs to evolve every season because immunity is produced in the prior season that can be circumvented, while measles confers “sterilizing immunity.”\nAnother difference is the speed of transmission.\nFlu is quite seasonal (loves cold, dry season).\nWe used to have measles outbreaks about every two years because it took about that long for more susceptible babies to be born.\nKingman’s Coalescent 1982\nfrom Loman and Pallen, Twenty years of bacterial genome sequencing,"

    "text": "5.1 Likelihood and Trees\nLikelihood differs from probability in that it assesses how likely data are, given a hypothesis.\nIt says nothing about how probable the hypothesis is, just the chances that it will give rise to the data if it is true.\nWe can start with a sequence and search the space of possible trees and substitution models to find those that make the sequence data the most likely.\nWe would start by looking for the tree. That tree is then given a score for how likely it is.\nAfter fitting the tree, then we look in the parameter space for the substitution model that improves the likelihood measure.\nThen go back and forth, iteratively.\nThis allows for the comparison of resulting phylogenies and substitution models with others in a quantifiable way.\nIn conclusion:\n\nRid yourself of the idea of one tree\nTrees are like calculus — you get better at interpreting them by looking at a lot of them\nSoftware packages for tree building accumulate, but you should think about it using the principles we’ve discussed"

They didn’t prove transmission, but it could have supported a null hypothesis (that transmission came from another observed patient).\nConsider short term vs. long term questions.\nFor short-term questions such as outbreak investigations, one wants quick data.\n\nWe want to study faster changing parts of the genome, since then it’s very unlikely two sequences are the same unless they’re related.\n\nFor longer term data, we want to study slower changing parts of the genome.\n\nIf things change too quickly, it’s harder to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree.\n\n\nAbove is data from the first long-term COVID infected person.\n\n45yo male\nSevere anti-phospholipid syndrome, history of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage\nTreated with steroids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, eculizumab\nAdmitted with COVID-19 in April\nFirst SARS-CoV-2 positive on April 10\nRe-admitted in June for repeat shortness of breath\nWhole-genome sequences were obtained for 4/28, 5/5, 6/24, 6/30\n\n\n\nShortly after, B.1.1.7 came out and looked like one of these"
