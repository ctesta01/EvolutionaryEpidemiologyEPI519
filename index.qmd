Evolutionary Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases (EPI519) with Bill Hanage.

Some themes from students' interests: 

  - How to apply microbiology to epidemiology? 
  - How to respond to pandemics, both naturally occuring and "engineered" ones?
  - Just thinking about *evolution* per se is it's own discipline that many are unfamiliar with. 
  - Pathogen evolution is not like other evolution.
  - Interest driven by the HIV/AIDS training grant 
  - Someone's research center is moving towards "Molecular Epidemiology"
  - Interaction between evolution in the pathogen, host, and environment 
  - Genomics
  - Vector-borne diseases
  - Folks coming from the Biological Sciences in Public Health degree program 

A core motive is to get biologists to care about statistics and to get statisticians to care about biology.
