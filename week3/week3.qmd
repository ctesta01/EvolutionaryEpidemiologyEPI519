# Sequences and Trees

What are sequences and trees useful for in evolutionary epidemiology?

-   Prediction capabilities
-   Determining is it a point-source, is everybody getting the same virus
-   Reconstructing transmission events
-   Seeing what evolution has happened outside human hosts
-   To see if a pathogen is completely new or related to something else
-   Looking for antimicrobial resistance
-   Inferring timing of a potential spillover event

Consistent rates in transcriptase, evolution rates, typically at the species level.

-   Can be used to identify groups of related strains which are particularly dangerous
-   Can identify the source of an epidemic
-   Can be used to identify residues under selection
-   Can discriminate between hypotheses e.g., did Europeans carry Hepatitis B to the New World, or bring it back with them
-   Can estimate transmission rates

We can figure out what genes are under selection pressure.

How might you figure out how things are related?

-   Distances measured based on nucleotides
-   Phenotypic similarity
-   Serotyping; do they activate the same antibodies?

Haemophelus influenzae is a bacterium named because they thought it caused flu.

Andrew Rambaut teaches this by having classes collect specimen, classify them based on how they look, and then they sequence them.

What creates differences between sequences in an alignment?

-   Insertions/Deletions
-   Recombinations
-   Translocation
-   Point-mutation
-   Inversion
-   Data reading error/Artifacts
    -   Incomplete sequence
-   Alignment errors

His list:

-   Mutations
-   Indels
-   Recombination
-   Errors in raw sequence data
-   Errors in bioinformatic processing
-   Errors in alignment
-   You

Hanage's Second Law: Anything you discover that is extremely novel, exciting, is almost certainly wrong.

Are all changes equally likely to be observed? Why?

No, because a lot of amino acids can be produced in lots of ways, so you can have different genes (where there's no selection pressure against it) that can code for the same amino acid.

Also, no, because of different levels of selection.

![](images/nucleotide_changes.png)

There is a very strong bias towards preserving the bias. You cannot weight transitions the same as transversions in a distance metric.

![](images/genetic_code.png)

For many of these triplets, the third nucleotide has no effect in what is coded.

Imagine comparing the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous change – dN/dS. What does it mean if this is small? And if it is large?

More synonymous than non-synonymous change is associated with purifying change, and vice versa.

-   Because mutations accumulate with time, we can use trees for dating
-   With infectious diseases we can make use of ‘measurably evolving populations’ for this
-   Sample over time, and plot branch length against time of isolation

![](images/regression_on_diversity.png)

![](images/guardian_article.png)

The dN/dS ratio is often larger when comparing more closely related things. Especially evident with epidemiologic data, where they may share an ancestor a few years ago. Why?

-   Ecologic niches
-   Also it takes time to weed out mutations with negative impact

Genetic drift

Time wasn't enough to weed out the bad non-synonymous mutations.

Answer: Incomplete purifying selection.

We never see mutations that are incredibly lethal to the species, but we can see mutations that are somewhat or close to lethal to the species.

John Maynard Smith is in Bill's intellectual lineage;

His address is given as Haldane's Right Hand Side — Haldane was his advisor.

# Making a Tree

Group the most similar together (smallest distance) are grouped together at an additional node.

Continue to add sequences until none are left.

An iterative process, where we start by joining the closest, then the next closest, etc., etc.,

But we need to weight the process by a substitution model.

Such clustering algorithms:

-   Are computationally simple and fast
-   Give one tree
-   May obscure conflicting signals in the data
-   Give no means of comparing hypotheses

## Likelihood and Trees

Likelihood differs from probability in that it assesses how likely data are, given a hypothesis.

It says nothing about how probable the hypothesis is, just the chances that it will give rise to the data if it is true.

We can start with a sequence and search the space of possible trees and substitution models to find those that make the sequence data the most likely.

We would start by looking for the tree. That tree is then given a score for how likely it is.

After fitting the tree, then we look in the parameter space for the substitution model that improves the likelihood measure.

Then go back and forth, iteratively.

This allows for the comparison of resulting phylogenies and substitution models with others in a quantifiable way.

In conclusion:

-   Rid yourself of the idea of one tree
-   Trees are like calculus — you get better at interpreting them by looking at a lot of them
-   Software packages for tree building accumulate, but you should think about it using the principles we've discussed

![](images/measles_flu.png)

In theory, influenza needs to evolve every season because immunity is produced in the prior season that *can* be circumvented, while measles confers "sterilizing immunity."

Another difference is the speed of transmission.

Flu is quite seasonal (loves cold, dry season).

We used to have measles outbreaks about every two years because it took about that long for more susceptible babies to be born.

## Trees and the Law

![](images/louisiana_v_schmidt.png)

-   In January 1995, a Lafayette LA nurse tested positive for HIV-1
-   She was HIV-negative when giving blood less than a year previously
-   All 7 sexual partners reported between 1984 and 1995 were tested and found to be HIV negative
-   The patient claimed that she had been deliberately infected by her boyfriend, a gastroenterologist, on Aug 5th 94
-   He had injected her with blood from an HIV positive patient, claiming it was a vitamin B12 shot
-   The prosecution found that an HIV-1 patient had blood drawn in the doctor’s office on Aug 4th 1994

Molecular evidence of HIV-1 transmission in a criminal case, Michael L. Metzker, David P. Mindell, Xiao-Mei Liu, +2 , and David M. Hillis, PNAS, 2002 <https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.222522599>

![](images/bootstrap_phylo.jpeg)

The boyfriend was convicted, but they appealed.

The appeal rested on the idea that the idea were not collected "as per an epidemiological investigation" — possibility of contamination.

Lots of the data came from men who have sex with men — so

The reason the appeal was thrown out was because the data could have ruled out transmission. They didn't prove transmission, but it could have supported a null hypothesis (that transmission came from another observed patient).

Consider short term vs. long term questions.

For short-term questions such as outbreak investigations, one wants quick data.

-   We want to study faster changing parts of the genome, since then it's very unlikely two sequences are the same unless they're related.

For longer term data, we want to study slower changing parts of the genome.

-   If things change too quickly, it's harder to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree.

Above is data from the first long-term COVID infected person.

-   45yo male
-   Severe anti-phospholipid syndrome, history of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
-   Treated with steroids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, eculizumab
-   Admitted with COVID-19 in April
-   First SARS-CoV-2 positive on April 10
-   Re-admitted in June for repeat shortness of breath
-   Whole-genome sequences were obtained for 4/28, 5/5, 6/24, 6/30

## Morals for Evolutionary Epidemiology

We want: Consistency, Context, and Clarity (we mean resolution) here.

Consistency:

-   Means that data should be unambiguous and easy to interpret

<!-- -->

-   Methods need to be consistent and standardized

Clarity:

-   If all isolates are exactly the same, we can’t say anything

<!-- -->

-   If all isolates are equally different from one another, we also can’t say anything

Context:

-   Can you relate results to the overall pathogen population structure?

-   Do you have enough sampling? Is it biased?

-   (Also metadata on type of disease, location etc)

Consider Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).

In 2014, this was considered best-in-class:

People use this because it's still cheap.

Typically we end up with a bunch of short reads.

Long read technologies are increasingly used – especially in a ‘hybrid’ approach

![](images/longread.png)

When people do this, they assemble short reads into "contigs" (contiguous sections). The fewer the contigs, the better.

Until very recently, we have systematically avoided looking at the diversity within patients in microbiology.

Different research questions would imply different rationales for how to choose where the root should be.

E.g., investigating an outbreak vs. investigating the evolution of antimicrobial resistance might imply different approaches to choosing the root location.
